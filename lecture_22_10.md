# Lawful interception of internet traffic
22.10.19

No recording of this lecture

### Mobile payment
several private and public actors involved in making the system work.

for most organizations the non-core business is outsourced, even more companies.
Every system runs on hardware bought from other companies. The hardware in turn runs software to run the hardware.


### Supply and service chains


### Properties of digital value chains
- faults propagate instantly and unpredictably
- services span multiple sectors
- overview is hard
- some services are platforms for large amount of other services (long value chain)

**Email is main attack vector for all cyber attacks**

## Interception of internet traffic in Norway
Very little network traffic is local to only Norway. Email from norwegian to another norwegian crosses the boarders.

**What tools should e-service have disposable to secure the digital space in Norway.**

### Digital border / Lawful interception
Several countries have implemented this.

### E service mission
Obtains information about forgien states operations
Does not fight crime etc.
Are not allowed to collect information about Norwegians in Norway.

Sovergain and National survelance is seperated in many contries.

##### Why now
The world have changed.
- international cyber attacks
- terror over the internett
- tech changes (internet)

### Privacy is under technological pressure
Not only security conecerns, personal pricacy, rights, human right

Techonlogiacl changes follow a S-curve.

Two current S-curves in development.
- Data collection about personal data is increasing. And that data crosses boarders
- Linking of such datasets to gain new insights.

Few unrelated datapoints needed to reliably learn new information about a person

### Privacy
What will be possible in 20 years?
- alot
What will be comprimising?
- impossible to know

### Why is this difficult
Almost all digital communication crosses borders.

### Lawful interception is only ok if
feasable?

Will it harm national trust in goverment?

gives value?

**People that make the technical decisions in Norway have no competence to make the decisions**

### Valuable intelligence

Allot of critical infrastructure is not properly secured

Attacks are discovered by the sercured bissnises. What about those that are not?

Hard to to forensics without a record of network activity into Norway. Or metadata over time log. What happend when.
*When X was attacked, Y was also contacted from that IP*

Requires storage of metadata over time without any due cause or reason.

Discover attacks that originate from Norway (botnet etc)

#### Metadata vs Content data
Content data need as legal assesment to retrive. Easy to box in.
Meta data is harder to decide.

### Legally acceptable

Human rights, article 7. Is incorporated in Norway.

LI will be tested in court. It has been in other countries.

Law is fuzzy, new laws are hardened and cleared by courts
The courts are still out.

Metadata collection is illegal for crime (Police). But for national security is still not settled.

### Maintain citizen trust
LI will not be able to be transparent. Hard to gain trust.


### LI control's

Pre approval for use (courts)
Continuous surveillance of use
After the fact control (stikkprÃ¸ver)

### LI cooling effect
Feeling of being watched has psychological effect. People are less likely to participate in the democracy.


# Huawei

#### best in class 5G tech

Cisco has been used for the thing Huawei is accused off (Snowden docs)


### Can we just search the products for hidden stuff?
El-system are complex. Volkswagen engineers created systems that detected that they where in a test situation.

### What can we do? (small country)

Norway do not have the industry.

Cyber sec industry is built around vendor trust.

### SOTP

#### Scenarios
- Vendor is malicous at time of delvery
- Vendor becomes malicous

El-equipment receives patches and updates during product life-cycle.

### What is el equimentnt?

curciets -> HAL -> OS -> Application

Every part of the stack has a supply chain. (Comppilators, source code, curcuits spec)

Backdoors can be injected at any point in the supply chain

**The development team at the vendor does not need to know about backdoors being injected.**

Every processor has unique instructor set with accompanied compilators.

### The question
- Can a machine check if machine code from another machine is ok? (NO)

**Short answer, cannot analyse el.equipment with 100% certainty.**

Solution:
**Diversify the infrastructure**
